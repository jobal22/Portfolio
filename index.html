                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>I am a web developer and recent graduate of the 
                    Software Engineering bootcamp at Thinkful. My love 
                    for coding developed from my passion for nonverbal 
                    languages (ex. music, truth-functioning logic, and 
                    predicate logic) and verbal languages. Also, my love 
                    for coding flourishes within my enthusiasm for 
                    problem-solving and devotion to research.</p>
                </div> 
                <div>
                    <p>Prior to my studies at Thinkful, I graduated with 
                    a B.S. in Toxicology from the University of Monroe in Louisiana, 
                    MDiv in International Church Planting and Ph.D. in Evangelism 
                    from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. During my B.S., 
                    I learned the skills for picking up complex concepts through 
                    courses such as Analytical Qualitative and Quantitative 
                    Chemical Analysis. In my MDiv, I obtained the confidence to work 
                    cross-culturally as the degree required for me to live in remote 
                    and nonremote foreign countries. But it was during my Ph.D. that 
                    I acquired the skills for leadership, teaching, and coordinating. 
                    I believe the abilities to quickly understand complex concepts, 
                    reach across cultural barriers, lead, and train are the key strengths 
                    that I will add to any team.</p>
